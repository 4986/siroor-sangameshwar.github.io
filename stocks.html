    In stock market world we have two aspects they are. <br />
    BULL and BEAR or we say as BULLISH/BEARISH market
    <br />
    When someone is bullish, <br />
    it means they are expecting prices to rise over a certain period of time.<br />
    What does it mean to be bearish?<br />
    it means to expect that prices will be falling over a period of time.<br />
    I am always interested in indulging myself in some Technology related
    things.
    <br />
    My career goal is seeking a job opportunity as a <br />
    software engineer
